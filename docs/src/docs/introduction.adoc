== Introduction to the Spring Security UI Plugin

The Spring Security UI plugin provides CRUD screens and other user management workflows.

The CRUD screens are protected from cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks through the use of the `useToken` attribute in forms. More information is available at http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/theWebLayer.html#formtokens.

Non-default functionality is available only if the feature is available; this includes the ACL controllers and views which are enabled if the http://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-acl[ACL plugin] is installed, Requestmaps support which is available if `grails.plugin.springsecurity.securityConfigType` is set to `"Requestmap"` or `SecurityConfigType.Requestmap` in `application.groovy`, and persistent cookies support which is enabled if it has been configured with the `s2-create-persistent-token` script.


=== Installation

Add an entry in the `dependencies` block of your `build.gradle` file, changing the version as needed:

[source,groovy]
[subs="attributes"]
.`build.gradle`
----
dependencies {
   ...
   compile 'org.grails.plugins:spring-security-ui:{projectVersion}'
   ...
----

NOTE: Master branch is for Grails 4, which uses Spring Security 5 and Spring 5
See the spring-security-core plugin for details such as how password encodings have changed (salts).

NOTE: Version 3.1.x is only compatible with Grails 3.3.x or higher.

For previous Grails 3 versions ( 3.0.x, 3.1.x and 3.2.x ) use:

[source,groovy]
[subs="attributes"]
.`build.gradle`
----
dependencies {
   ...
   compile 'org.grails.plugins:spring-security-ui:3.0.2'
   ...
----

Also be sure to update the versions when new releases are available.
